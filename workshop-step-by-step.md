# Building a Geospatial Agentic AI Stack on AWS — Workshop Guide

**Turn raw geospatial data into intelligence.** Powered by Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL (PostGIS), Wherobots, and Felt.

**Duration:** ~90 minutes
**Level:** Intermediate (comfortable with Python & command line)

---

## What You'll Build

An end-to-end geospatial AI pipeline that scores **357,263 buildings in the City of San Diego** for wildfire, flood, and severe weather risk — then lets you explore them through natural language prompts that generate interactive maps.

**Part 1 — Agentic Data Engineering** (~35 min)
Walk through a Wherobots MCP-powered medallion pipeline (Bronze → Silver → Gold) that turns satellite imagery and weather events into per-building risk scores stored in Aurora PostgreSQL.

**Part 2 — Map Builder AI Agent** (~40 min)
Run an AI agent that takes prompts like *"Show me buildings with high wildfire risk near Poway"* and creates styled, interactive Felt maps — powered by Strands Agents SDK, Amazon Bedrock (Claude), and Felt.

---

## The Data Story

San Diego sits at the intersection of three natural hazards:

- **Wildfire** — The canyon edges along Mission Trails Regional Park (Tierrasanta, San Carlos, Del Cerro) and Scripps Ranch, where the 2003 Cedar Fire destroyed hundreds of homes, are the city's wildland-urban interface. **97,412 buildings** (27%) carry some wildfire exposure; wildfire is what lifts a building from high to critical.
- **Severe weather** — Radar-detected storm cells and hail within 25 km touch **99% of all buildings** at some level, and storm density is what separates the tiers inside the city.
- **Flood** — Rare. In the December-to-March window no city footprint saw satellite-observed water, so the flood factor is zero for every building; at county scale 114 buildings did.

The same building gets **different risk scores** depending on who's asking:
- An **insurer** weights wildfire and flood equally (0.40/0.40) — they care about claims
- A **real estate investor** weights severe weather highest (0.35) — they care about long-term value
- An **energy company** weights wildfire at 0.40 — they care about grid infrastructure near vegetation

This is what you'll explore: ~1M buildings, 4 industry perspectives, one map.

## Prerequisites

### Accounts & API Keys

| What | Where to get it | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| **Felt account** | [felt.com](https://felt.com) | Part 1 + 2 |
| **Felt API token** | Felt → Settings → Integrations — starts with `felt_pat_...` | Part 2 |
| **Wherobots account** | [cloud.wherobots.com](https://cloud.wherobots.com) — org must be **Professional or Enterprise tier** (MCP access is not available on Community orgs) | Part 1 |
| **Wherobots API key** | Wherobots Console → API Keys — generate it in the Professional/Enterprise-tier org | Part 1 |
| **AWS account** | Your own AWS account with admin/CFN permissions | Part 1 + 2 |
| **Aurora PostgreSQL** | Deployed by you in **Step 2** via CloudFormation | Part 1 + 2 |
| **AWS Bedrock model access** | Enable Claude Opus 4.8 in `us-west-2` (Bedrock console → Model access) | Part 2 |

> **Note:** Each participant deploys their own AWS stack. The CloudFormation template in `deploy-aurora/cloudformation.yaml` provisions Aurora, the VPC, and the Bedrock IAM role. Follow the links above to create the Felt and Wherobots accounts.
>
> **Wherobots tier check:** the Wherobots MCP server is gated by org tier. If your API key belongs to a Community-tier org, every MCP call fails with `MCP access is not enabled for your organization` — you'll need a key from a Professional or Enterprise org (workshop instructors can provide one). Verify your tier in the Wherobots Console under **Settings → Organization** before the session.

### Software

| What | Version | Check with |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.10+ | `python3 --version` |
| pip | latest | `pip --version` |
| git | any | `git --version` |
| AWS CLI | v2 | `aws --version` |
| Kiro IDE | latest | [kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev) (optional, recommended) |
| Wherobots Extension | latest | Install via `kiro --install-extension wherobots.wherobotsjobsubmit` |

---

## Setup (~25 min)

### Step 1 — Clone & install

> **Python 3.10+ needed.** macOS's `python3` is 3.9.6 (too old) — `brew install python@3.13`, then use `python3.13 -m venv .venv` below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prantogg/aws-felt-wherobots-workshop.git
cd aws-felt-wherobots-workshop
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r part2_map_agent/requirements.txt
```

Verify the install:

```bash
python -c "import strands, strands_tools, felt_python; print('venv ready')"
```

A successful clone, install, and verify looks like this:

![Step 1 — clone, install, and verify the venv](screenshots/step1-clone-install.png)

### Step 2 — Deploy the AWS stack (~10 min)

Each participant deploys their own Aurora cluster, VPC, and Bedrock IAM role.
The stack also auto-seeds `workshop.insurance_exposure` so Part 2 has data to
query before Part 1's pipeline finishes.

> **Before deploying:** make sure Bedrock model access for **Claude Opus 4.8**
> (`anthropic.claude-opus-4-8`) is enabled in `us-west-2`. Bedrock console →
> *Model access* → *Manage model access*.

Deploy the stack (pick a strong password — you'll put it in `.env` next step):

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file deploy-aurora/cloudformation.yaml \
  --stack-name cloudformation \
  --parameter-overrides \
      DBMasterUsername=workshop_admin \
      DBMasterPassword='ChangeMe-StrongPassword123!' \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region us-west-2
```

Aurora Serverless v2 takes ~8–10 minutes to come up. Once `deploy` returns,
grab the outputs:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name cloudformation \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' \
  --output table
```

Note the `AuroraEndpoint` value — you'll need it in Step 3.

The outputs table looks like this — `AuroraDSN`, `BedrockRoleArn`, `VpcId`, and `AuroraEndpoint`:

![Step 2 — deploy the stack and read its outputs](screenshots/step2-deploy-stack.png)

> **Verify the auto-seed (optional):** the stack runs a Lambda that creates the
> `workshop` schema and bulk-loads `workshop.insurance_exposure` from S3. To
> confirm:
>
> ```bash
> psql "postgresql://workshop_admin:<PASSWORD>@<AuroraEndpoint>:5432/workshop" \
>   -c "SELECT count(*) FROM workshop.insurance_exposure;"
> ```
>
> Expect 357,263 rows once the seed has been regenerated from the City of San Diego run (the older seed file holds 1,035,306 county-scale rows). If empty, the `AuroraSeed` Lambda log in CloudWatch will explain why.

> **Region note:** Everything in this workshop runs in `us-west-2` — Aurora,
> Wherobots, and Bedrock. Make sure your Bedrock model access (above) is enabled
> in `us-west-2`.

> **Tear-down:** `aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name cloudformation --region us-west-2`

### Step 3 — Configure credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with the Aurora endpoint from Step 2 plus your other credentials:

```bash
# Wherobots Cloud
WHEROBOTS_API_KEY=your-wherobots-api-key

# Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL (PostGIS)
AURORA_DSN=postgresql://user:password@your-aurora-host:5432/workshop

# Felt
FELT_API_TOKEN=your-felt-api-token
# Optional — defaults to "workshop-db". Step 6 creates the Felt source with
# this name and the Part 2 agent looks it up by the same name.
FELT_SOURCE_NAME=workshop-db

# AWS (for Bedrock)
AWS_PROFILE=default
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

### Step 4 — Set up Kiro with Wherobots extension (recommended)

If you're using Kiro, install the Wherobots extension for integrated catalog browsing, AI-assisted notebook authoring, and remote compute:

1. Install: `kiro --install-extension wherobots.wherobotsjobsubmit`
2. Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) → **Wherobots: Set API Key** → paste your Wherobots key
3. The extension auto-configures the MCP server and Data Hub sidebar

> **Always open Kiro with `scripts/kiro.sh`** from the repo root. Kiro fills in the `${WHEROBOTS_API_KEY}`, `${FELT_API_TOKEN}` and `${AURORA_DSN}` placeholders in `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` from the environment it was started with, not from `.env`. Opening Kiro from the Dock leaves the placeholders unresolved and the MCP servers fail. `scripts/kiro.sh --check` shows which values `.env` provides. If the MCP servers panel shows nothing at all, check that **Kiro Agent: Configure MCP** is Enabled in Settings.

To connect notebooks to Wherobots compute (needed for Part 1):
1. Wherobots sidebar → **Create Workspace** → set region and instance size (**Medium** for `bronze-to-silver`, about 13 minutes for the City of San Diego; **Small** for `silver-to-gold`, about 3 minutes; the county run needs **Large** and about 35 minutes) → **Start**
2. Open a `.ipynb` file → select the Wherobots remote runtime as your kernel
3. Code now executes on Wherobots Cloud (Sedona)

### Step 5 — Configure MCP servers

Kiro users are done: the repo ships `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` with the Wherobots, Felt and Aurora servers and the read-only tools pre-approved. For VS Code or Claude Desktop, add the same servers to your IDE's MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wherobots": {
      "url": "https://api.cloud.wherobots.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "${WHEROBOTS_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "felt": {
      "url": "https://felt.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${FELT_API_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> For Felt MCP setup details and IDE-specific instructions, see the [Felt MCP help doc](https://help.felt.com/felt-ai/mcp).

### Step 6 — Connect Felt to Aurora PostgreSQL

This creates a **Felt data source** named `workshop-db` so the Map Builder Agent (Part 2) — and the Felt MCP — can query Aurora and build maps directly from it. **Don't skip this step:** the agent's first move is `list_data_sources` to find Aurora — if no source exists, that call returns empty and the entire Part 2 flow stops.

#### Option A — one command via the Felt API (recommended)

Works with just your `FELT_API_TOKEN` — no Felt UI login needed (this is the route for pre-provisioned workshop tokens). It reads the connection details from the `.env` you filled in Step 3:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a

curl -sS -X POST https://felt.com/api/v2/sources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FELT_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(python3 - << 'PYEOF'
import json, os
from urllib.parse import urlparse, unquote
u = urlparse(os.environ["AURORA_DSN"])
print(json.dumps({
    "name": os.environ.get("FELT_SOURCE_NAME", "workshop-db"),
    "connection": {
        "type": "postgresql",
        "host": u.hostname,
        "port": u.port or 5432,
        "database": (u.path or "").lstrip("/") or "workshop",
        "user": unquote(u.username or ""),
        "password": unquote(u.password or ""),
    },
    "permissions": {"type": "workspace_editors"},
}))
PYEOF
)"
```

The API returns `202 Accepted` and indexes the source asynchronously. Verify it shows up (look for `"name": "workshop-db"` with `sync_status` progressing to `completed`):

```bash
curl -sS https://felt.com/api/v2/sources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FELT_API_TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
```

> API reference: [developers.felt.com/rest-api/api-reference/sources](https://developers.felt.com/rest-api/api-reference/sources)

#### Option B — Felt UI

1. In the Felt left sidebar, under **Data sources**, click **+ → New data source**.
2. Under **External**, choose **Postgres / PostGIS**.
3. Fill in the connection (use the `AuroraEndpoint` from Step 2):
   - **Source name:** `workshop-db` — must match your `FELT_SOURCE_NAME` (default `workshop-db`) exactly; the agent looks this name up at startup
   - **Host:** your Aurora writer endpoint · **Port:** `5432`
   - **Database:** `workshop`
   - **Username / Password:** `workshop_admin` + the password you set at deploy
   - **Schema:** leave blank (Felt searches all schemas)
   - **Access:** Public — so the whole workspace can use it
   - **IP allowlist:** Felt connects from a fixed set of U.S. IPs (shown on the right of the form); your Aurora security group must allow them — the workshop CloudFormation already does.
4. Felt connects and indexes the source — you'll see **"Authenticated to workshop-db"**, then **"Indexing source."**
5. When indexing finishes, browse **`workshop.insurance_exposure`** to preview the rows, then click **Create map** (optional — the agent can also use the source directly).

</p>

> **Instructor-led workshops:** instructors should pre-create the `workshop-db` source (Option A works with any workspace admin token). Participants: verify it exists with the `curl … /api/v2/sources` command above before starting Part 2 — if the list is empty, run Option A.
>
> **Network note:** Felt connects from its infrastructure to Aurora. The workshop CloudFormation makes Aurora publicly reachable and allowlists Felt's IPs.

## Part 1: Agentic Data Engineering with Wherobots MCP (~35 min)

### Overview

In this part, you'll walk through how the **Wherobots MCP server** was used to build a medallion data pipeline that transforms raw satellite and weather data into per-building risk scores. The data is already in Aurora PostgreSQL — you'll explore how it got there and what it means.

```

### Step 1 — Explore the data catalog with Wherobots MCP (10 min)

The Wherobots MCP connects to a massive catalog of geospatial data. Let's explore what's available.

**Try these prompts in your MCP chat:**

> *"What tables are available in org_catalog.noaa_swdi?"*

This shows the severe weather datasets: hail events, radar-identified storm cells, and tornado vortex signatures.

> *"Describe the schema of wherobots_open_data.overture_maps_foundation.buildings_building"*

This is the Overture Maps building footprint dataset — every building polygon in the world.

> *"Show me 5 sample rows from org_catalog.noaa_swdi.hail where the geometry is within San Diego County"*

This shows actual hail events with location, severity, and timestamp.

**What you're seeing:** The first two prompts use the catalog and schema tools, which read metadata and return instantly even for tables with billions of rows. The third prompt runs SQL: the first SQL query of a session starts a SQL runtime, which takes about 90 seconds; later queries return in seconds.

**Available datasets:**

| Source | Catalog Table | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overture Buildings | `wherobots_open_data.overture_maps_foundation.buildings_building` | Vector | 2.5 billion footprints worldwide; ~357K in the City of San Diego, ~1.03M in the county |
| USFS Burn Probability | `org_catalog.wildfire_risk.burn_probability_conus` | Raster | Annual burn probability grid, CONUS, 30 m (24 GB) |
| USFS Flame Length | `org_catalog.wildfire_risk.conditional_flame_length_conus` | Raster | Expected flame length if fire occurs, CONUS, 30 m (22 GB) |
| OPERA DSWx-S1 | `org_catalog.opera.dswx_s1` | Raster | Sentinel-1 SAR surface water / flood (30 m), Southern California, Dec 2025 – Mar 2026 |
| NOAA SWDI — Hail | `org_catalog.noaa_swdi.hail` | Vector | 26M hail detections, 2024–2025, with severity |
| NOAA SWDI — Storm cell structure | `org_catalog.noaa_swdi.structure` | Vector | 83M radar-identified storm cells of any intensity (max reflectivity, VIL, cell heights), 2024–2025 |
| NOAA SWDI — TVS | `org_catalog.noaa_swdi.tvs` | Vector | 93K tornado vortex signatures, 2024–2025 |
| NOAA SWDI — Warnings | `org_catalog.noaa_swdi.warn` | Vector | Warning polygons 2001–2016 (archive; not used by the pipeline) |

### Step 2 — Walkthrough: Bronze → Silver pipeline (10 min)

Open the notebook at `part1_data_engineering/bronze-to-silver.ipynb`. This was **generated by the Wherobots MCP** using the pipeline skill (`part1_data_engineering/skills/wherobots-pipeline/SKILL.md`).

The Silver layer enriches each building with hazard data through three spatial operations:

**Wildfire exposure** — Zonal statistics (`RS_ZonalStats`):
| Input | Operation | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Overture Buildings + USFS Burn Probability raster | Extract mean/max burn probability for each building footprint | `asset_wildfire_exposure` — wildfire_factor per building |

> **Key insight:** A building near Poway might sit directly on high burn probability land, while its neighbor 200m away is shielded by a ridge. This is why nearby buildings get different scores.

**Flood exposure** — Weekly zonal statistics (per ISO week):
| Input | Operation | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Overture Buildings + OPERA DSWx-S1 SAR flood raster (weekly) | For each ISO week in the flood window, zonal-stat max water-classification per building → append to Iceberg | `asset_flood_exposure` — one row per (asset, week); silver-to-gold aggregates to max class, event count, duration |

**Severe weather density** — KNN spatial join (`ST_KNN`):
| Input | Operation | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Overture Buildings + NOAA SWDI (hail, storm cells, TVS) | Find 10 nearest weather events within 25km | `asset_weather_density` — event counts at 5km and 25km thresholds |

> **Try it yourself:** Ask the Wherobots MCP: *"How many hail events occurred within 25km of downtown San Diego (32.72, -117.16) in the past year?"*

### Step 3 — Walkthrough: Silver → Gold scoring (5 min)

Open the notebook at `part1_data_engineering/silver-to-gold.ipynb`. This applies a **4-step scoring framework**:

> **Aurora connection:** the notebook runs on a Wherobots kernel, which cannot see your laptop's environment or `.env`. Before running it, run once from the repo root:
>
> ```bash
> set -a; source .env; set +a
> python3 scripts/upload_env_to_wherobots.py
> ```
>
> This uploads only the `AURORA_DSN` line to your Wherobots managed storage, where the notebook's config cell finds it through the `USER_S3_PATH` variable Wherobots sets on every runtime; nothing in the notebook is edited. Without it the config cell stops with a clear error, the 4 Gold tables never land in Aurora, and Part 2 only sees the CloudFormation-seeded `insurance_exposure`.

**1. Normalize** — Min-max scale each hazard metric to [0, 1]
**2. Weight** — Apply industry-specific weights:

| Industry | Wildfire | Flood | Severe Weather | Why this weighting? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Insurance | 0.40 | 0.40 | 0.20 | Claims are driven by fire and flood |
| Commercial Real Estate | 0.30 | 0.35 | 0.35 | Long-term value affected by all hazards |
| Capital Markets | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.50 | Operational disruption from weather events |
| Energy & Utilities | 0.40 | 0.20 | 0.40 | Grid infrastructure near vegetation and storm paths |

**3. Classify** — Assign risk tiers by percentile rank of the score within the area, so every industry gets a comparable distribution regardless of how its raw scores are spread:

| Tier | Percentile of `risk_score` |
|---|---|
| Critical | top 5% |
| High | 80th – 95th |
| Elevated | 50th – 80th |
| Moderate | 20th – 50th |
| Low | bottom 20% |

Tied scores are common (most buildings have zero flood and near-zero wildfire), so the realised shares deviate from these cuts at the bottom: in the City of San Diego run, insurance lands at 5.0% critical as designed but only 2.2% high and 39.7% elevated, because most buildings in the middle of the distribution tie.

**4. Derive** — Compute industry-specific metrics (e.g., `triage_priority`, `outage_probability`)

**The weighting matters:** each industry also reads a different aspect of each hazard (insurance uses mean burn probability and flood duration; energy uses flame length and events within 5 km), so the rankings diverge. In the City of San Diego run the insurer flags 17,864 critical buildings and the utility 5,441, but only **725** are critical for both; **14,807** of the insurer's critical buildings are low or moderate for the utility, and only 13% of buildings (47,216 of 357,263) land in the same tier under both lenses. Same data, different lens.

> 📖 See `part1_data_engineering/data_dictionary.md` for the full schema and business logic of every table.

### Step 4 — Verify the Gold tables in Aurora (10 min)

The Gold tables were exported to Aurora PostgreSQL via JDBC. Let's verify and explore them.

**Check row counts:**
```bash
python3 -c "
import psycopg2, os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
conn = psycopg2.connect(os.environ['AURORA_DSN'])
cur = conn.cursor()
for table in ['insurance_exposure', 'cre_risk', 'capital_markets_signals', 'energy_asset_risk']:
    cur.execute(f'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workshop.{table}')
    print(f'workshop.{table}: {cur.fetchone()[0]:,} rows')
conn.close()
"
```

**Expected output:**
```
workshop.insurance_exposure: 357,263 rows
workshop.cre_risk: 357,263 rows
workshop.capital_markets_signals: 357,263 rows
workshop.energy_asset_risk: 357,263 rows
```

**Explore the risk distribution:**

Ask the Felt MCP (or run these SQL queries directly):

> *"Query the workshop-db data source: show me the risk tier distribution for insurance_exposure — count of buildings and average score per tier"*

You should see:

| Tier | Buildings | Avg Score | Dominant Driver |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| critical | 17,864 | 0.203 | Storm density (0.87) plus the wildfire edge (avg factor 0.07, ten times any other tier) |
| high | 8,013 | 0.172 | Storm density (0.85) |
| elevated | 141,719 | 0.170 | Storm density (0.84) |
| moderate | 103,052 | 0.136 | Storm density (0.67) |
| low | 86,615 | 0.102 | Lower storm density (0.50); wildfire and flood zero |

**What to notice:**
- **Storm density drives the tiers inside the city.** The severe-weather factor climbs from 0.50 in the low tier to 0.87 in critical, and 355,244 of 357,263 buildings have some storm exposure. Wildfire is small in absolute terms but is what separates critical from high (0.072 against 0.007). Flood is zero for every building: no city footprint saw satellite-observed water between December and March
- **Risk is localized along the canyon edges.** Within 3 km of Tierrasanta and of San Carlos and Del Cerro, along Mission Trails Regional Park, about 48% of buildings are high or critical; Scripps Ranch, where the 2003 Cedar Fire burned, 25%; downtown 2.3%; Rancho Bernardo none
- **7% of the city is high or critical** (25,877 buildings), not the 20% the percentile cuts promise, because tied scores collapse the high tier; the story is *where* they are, not how many
- Different industry tables weight the **same hazards differently** and read different metrics — only 13% of buildings share a tier between insurance and energy
- Tiers are **relative to the AOI you ran**. At county scale the eastern wildland-urban interface (Ramona, Julian) takes the top tier and the city's canyon edges move down the ranking. Same data, different frame

> **Try it:** *"Query workshop-db: what are the top 10 buildings by risk_score in workshop.insurance_exposure? Show asset_id, risk_score, wildfire_factor, flood_factor, and severe_weather_factor"*

### Key Takeaways — Part 1

- **Wherobots MCP** gives you an AI-accessible interface to spatial data catalogs and processing — you didn't write Sedona code by hand
- The **medallion architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) separates raw ingestion from enrichment from business scoring
- **Spatial operations** (zonal stats, KNN joins) run server-side on Apache Sedona — even billions of rows
- **JDBC export** moves Gold tables directly from Wherobots to Aurora in minutes
- The same data pipeline supports **4 different industry verticals** with different scoring weights from identical source data
- The risk story is **localized**: half the buildings along Mission Trails score high or critical, almost none downtown do, and storm density with a wildfire edge is what decides it

## Part 2: Map Builder AI Agent (~40 min)

### Overview

Now let's make the data visual. You'll run an AI agent that turns natural language prompts into interactive Felt maps. The agent:

1. Connects to the **Felt MCP server** (`https://felt.com/mcp`) for map operations
2. Uses **Amazon Bedrock (Claude)** to interpret prompts and orchestrate MCP tool calls
3. Queries Aurora directly via Felt's data source connection
4. Returns a shareable map URL with an inline preview

The agent uses MCP tools directly — no code generation required for standard workflows. For complex transforms, it falls back to `python_repl`.

### Prerequisites for Part 2

Part 2 runs the Strands agent locally in **the Python virtualenv you created in
Setup Step 1**. Before continuing, make sure you have it activated:

```bash
# From the repo root
source .venv/bin/activate
python -c "import strands, strands_tools; print('venv OK')"
```

If `.venv/` doesn't exist or the import errors, re-run Setup Step 1:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r part2_map_agent/requirements.txt
```

`./run.sh` auto-sources `.venv/bin/activate` for each invocation, but the venv
itself must already exist. Without it you'll see `ModuleNotFoundError: No
module named 'strands_tools'` (or similar) when the agent starts.

### Step 1 — Navigate to the agent and understand the tools (5 min)

```bash
cd part2_map_agent
```

The agent uses **Felt MCP tools** as its primary interface:

| MCP Tool | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `list_data_sources` | Find the Aurora database connection |
| `create_map` | Create a new Felt map |
| `create_layer_from_data_source` | Add a layer via SQL query |
| `poll_layer_processing_status` | Wait for layer to finish |
| `generate_fsl` | AI-powered style generation |
| `update_layer_properties` | Apply styles to layers |
| `render_map` | Show inline map preview |

The agent also has **fallback skills** in `skills/`:

**`felt-mapping/SKILL.md`** — Documents the MCP tool workflow and SQL patterns

**`aurora-postgis/SKILL.md`** — Fallback for direct psycopg2 access when MCP fails

### Step 2 — Run the agent: from a simple map to a stunning one (15 min)

Start the agent in **interactive mode**:

```bash
./run.sh
```

> **Which data will you see?** Aurora starts seeded with a San Diego **County** run (about 1.03M buildings), which is what this section describes. If you completed Part 1, your Gold run replaced those tables with your **City of San Diego** results (357,263 buildings), so your maps will show the city and smaller counts than the ones below.

The agent will prompt you for what to map. Try this first prompt — it builds a single-layer **triage map** of the buildings an underwriter should look at first:

> **Suggested prompt:** *"As an insurance underwriter, map the high and critical risk buildings across San Diego County on a dark basemap, colored by risk tier — red for high, dark red for critical."*

**What happens behind the scenes (MCP tool calls):**
1. `list_data_sources` → finds the Aurora PostgreSQL connection
2. `create_map` → creates a new Felt map over San Diego County on a dark basemap
3. `create_layer_from_data_source` → SQL query for the high + critical risk buildings
4. `poll_layer_processing_status` → waits for the layer to finish
5. `generate_fsl` → builds a categorical style for `risk_tier`
6. `update_layer_properties` → applies the style
7. `render_map` → shows inline preview + returns URL

**What you'll see:** 21,501 buildings — and they rake across the **eastern backcountry** (Poway, Ramona, Julian), the wildland-urban interface, *not* the coast. The serious hazard sits at the county's edges: the inland critical (dark-red) buildings are wildfire-driven, while closer to the coast risk leans more on flood and severe weather. Wildfire is the escalator that pushes a building into the critical tier.

| Risk Tier | Count | On this map |
|-----------|------:|:-----------:|
| Critical  | 2,385 | 🟥 yes |
| High      | 19,116 | 🔴 yes |
| Elevated  | 66,271 | — |
| Moderate  | 920,415 | — |
| Low       | 27,119 | — |

Of ~1M buildings, only **21,501 (2%)** land in the high/critical tiers — that focus is the point of a triage map.

> **Tip:** Want to see what's driving each building's score? Ask the agent a follow-up: *"add a popup showing risk score and the wildfire, flood, and severe-weather factors."* Notice how wildfire climbs as you move inland.

</p>

#### Now make it cool — a heatmap that resolves into the buildings

Stay in the same agent session and add one more layer. This is where Felt's styling shines: a single follow-up prompt turns the flat building map into a **zoom-aware** view — a glowing risk-density heatmap when you're zoomed out, the individual buildings when you zoom in.

> **Suggested prompt:** *"Now add a risk-density layer: aggregate these buildings into an H3 hexbin heatmap colored by their average risk score, with fine bins. Make the heatmap fade out as I zoom in while the buildings fade in — so I see county-wide hotspots when zoomed out and the actual buildings when zoomed in."*

**What the agent does:**
1. `create_layer_from_data_source` → a second layer of building **centroids** (`ST_Centroid`) carrying `risk_score`
2. `generate_fsl` → an **H3 hexbin** style: `aggregation: mean` of `risk_score`, fine bins (`binMode: high`), a warm heat palette (`@ylRed`)
3. `update_layer_properties` on **both** layers → a zoom **opacity ramp**: the heatmap `{"linear": [[10, 0.9], [13, 0]]}` (fades out), the buildings `{"linear": [[11, 0], [13, 0.85]]}` (fades in)
4. `render_map`

**What you'll see:** Zoomed out, the county glows with **average-risk hotspots** — the San Marcos / Poway / backcountry concentrations pop, with none of the dot-mush of 21,000 overlapping footprints. Zoom past ~z12 and the heatmap dissolves into the **actual high/critical buildings**, tier-colored and clickable. Same data, two reading altitudes — overview and detail — entirely driven by style.

> **Why it works:** the zoom behavior lives in the FSL `opacity` ramp (`{"linear": [[zoom, value], …]}`) — no special layer-visibility toggle needed. H3 bins by point location, so the heatmap queries centroids; the building layer stays polygons.

</p>

### Step 3 — Explore with more prompts (15 min)

Continue in **interactive mode** — the agent remembers context from previous maps. Try these prompts to explore different perspectives:

---

**Spatial query (PostGIS in action):**

> *"What are the 100 highest-risk buildings within 10 miles of downtown San Diego (32.7157, -117.1611)? Show them on a map, and draw the 10-mile radius as a visible buffer circle for context."*

Triggers a `ST_DWithin` spatial query plus an `ST_Buffer` ring you can actually see (transparent fill, colored stroke). Expect ~100 markers inside the circle — mostly moderate risk from severe weather, not wildfire. The buffer makes the point visually: the worst (high/critical) buildings sit *outside* the metro ring, out in the eastern backcountry.

![Top 100 highest-risk buildings within 10 miles of downtown, with the 10-mile buffer ring](screenshots/step3-spatial-query.png)

---

**The wildfire story:**

> *"Map all buildings near Poway with wildfire_factor above 0.3. Use a heat gradient to show severity."*

These are the ~159 buildings at the wildland-urban interface. The gradient shows which specific buildings face the highest burn probability — the 2003 Cedar Fire and 2007 Witch Creek Fire swept through this exact area.

![Poway wildfire exposure — buildings with wildfire_factor > 0.3, colored by severity](screenshots/step3-wildfire-poway.png)

### Step 4 — Explore the Felt map (5 min)

Each map URL opens an interactive Felt map where you can:
- **Hover** over buildings to see risk scores and factor breakdowns
- **Filter** layers by attributes (e.g., show only `risk_tier = 'high'`)
- **Toggle** the burn probability raster layer to see raw wildfire data beneath
- **Share** the map URL with anyone — no login required to view
- **Add annotations** — draw, add text, mark up areas of interest

### Step 5 — Bonus: Felt MCP for conversational map exploration (5 min)

The Strands agent builds maps programmatically. But you can also explore data conversationally through the **Felt MCP** (`https://felt.com/mcp`).

If you have Felt MCP configured (from Setup Step 5), try asking in your MCP chat:

> *"Create a new map called 'Workshop Risk Explorer'. Add a layer from the workshop-db data source showing buildings where wildfire_factor > 0.5, styled categorically by risk_tier."*

Or query existing map data:

> *"What's the average risk score by building_class for buildings in the elevated tier?"*

This is the **business user** path — no Python, no agent code. Just natural language to maps.

> New to the Felt MCP? See the [Felt MCP help doc](https://help.felt.com/felt-ai/mcp) for setup and what it can do.

### Key Takeaways — Part 2

- The agent model is **skills + code execution** — not hardcoded tool wrappers
- **AgentSkills** (.md files) teach the agent domain knowledge at runtime
- The agent handles complex multi-step workflows: query → create map → style → screenshot
- **Felt source layers** connect directly to Aurora — maps stay live as data updates
- **Felt MCP** provides a conversational interface for business users without code
- Natural language makes spatial analysis accessible to non-technical users

## Putting It Together

Part 1 and Part 2 form a complete geospatial AI stack:

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Sources** | NOAA, USFS, OPERA (NASA), Overture Maps | Raw geospatial data |
| **Spatial Processing** | Wherobots Cloud (Apache Sedona) | Spatial joins, zonal stats, risk scoring |
| **Data Store** | Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL (PostGIS) | Production database with spatial indexing |
| **AI Orchestration** | AWS Strands Agents SDK + Amazon Bedrock | Natural language → code generation → execution |
| **Visualization** | Felt + Felt MCP | Interactive maps, styling, sharing, conversational exploration |

**Two modes of interaction:**
- **Developer** — Strands agent with skills + code execution (Part 2, Steps 2-4)
- **Business user** — Felt MCP or Felt's in-product AI agent (Part 2, Step 5)

**Two phases of the pipeline:**
- **Part 1** is the **data pipeline** — reproducible, automated, runs on a schedule
- **Part 2** is the **AI agent** — flexible, conversational, good for exploration and ad-hoc analysis

In production, you'd use both: pipelines to keep data fresh, agents to let anyone explore it.

## Next Steps

- **Productionize** — Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides runtime, identity, memory, and monitoring for deploying agents
- **More hazards** — Add earthquake, drought, or climate projection data to the scoring model
- **Custom weights** — Modify `risk_weights.yaml` to tune scoring for your specific use case
- **AWS Marketplace** — Felt and Wherobots are available on AWS Marketplace for enterprise deployment

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection refused` | Check Aurora host/port/credentials in `.env` |
| `FELT_API_TOKEN not set` | Add token to `.env` |
| `AccessDeniedException` from Bedrock | Check IAM permissions + Claude model access in Bedrock console. The role needs `bedrock:Converse` / `bedrock:ConverseStream` (the Strands SDK uses the Converse API) in addition to `bedrock:InvokeModel*` — on AWS Workshop Studio accounts, make sure `WSParticipantRole` includes them. |
| Wherobots MCP not connecting | Verify API key and `https://api.cloud.wherobots.com/mcp/` URL |
| `MCP access is not enabled for your organization` | Your Wherobots API key belongs to a Community-tier org. Use a key from a **Professional or Enterprise** org (see Prerequisites). |
| Felt MCP not connecting | Verify API token and `https://felt.com/mcp` URL |
| Felt map is empty after creation | Layer still processing — `wait_for_layer()` handles this |
| Agent generates wrong SQL | Schema is in the system prompt — check `agent.py` for table definitions |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Activate virtualenv: `source .venv/bin/activate` |
| Agent can't find Felt source / `list_data_sources` returns empty | The `workshop-db` source was never created — Setup Step 6 was skipped. Run the Step 6 Option A command to create it via the API. The agent resolves the source by name (`FELT_SOURCE_NAME`, default `workshop-db`), so the name must match exactly. |
